# Preposal
For my final project, I have had varied ideas, in one of them, I maybe make a program which can detect certain screens on a file you are reading, say you spend 1 minute on a certain page of a file, my program will consider that a highlight and leave a tab open for you to regress to that page, or maybe when you are on page, it may detect that some other page, say your on a textbook, has questions related to the content you are reading, and provide a quick skip to that, the basis for this project would be providing automated "skips" to pages based on certain parameters.
Another idea I have seen my mind meander upon, is, if it is not already wide-spreadly done, a program that takes a input from a user, and then arranges a chess board to their chosen opening, I don't believe it is already done, at least on chess.com, and I believe it could be a nice tool, to learn or be more efficient.
